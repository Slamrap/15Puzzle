# 15 Puzzle Game
In this puzzle the goal is to reach the final state, from an initial configuration. 
</br>For this the user chooses one of the search algorithms available, as well as which heuristic he intends to use. 
</br>The result obtained will have the necessary movements to reach the final state from the given initial configuration, as well as other useful 
statistics.
